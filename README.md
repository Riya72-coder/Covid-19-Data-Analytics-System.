# COVID-19 Data Analytics System 

## Overview
This project is a COVID-19 Data analytics system that provides insights into the pandemic using data visualizations, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling. It allows users to analyze trends, visualize correlations, and predict COVID-19 cases based on input data. Built using Python and Flask, this project showcases interactive graphs and tables to deliver meaningful information about the pandemic.

## Features
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Displays line plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and pie charts for COVID-19 data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes public sentiment data by state and visualizes weighted sentiments.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses machine learning to predict COVID-19 case trends.
- **Dynamic Tables**: View detailed state-wise sentiment data on a separate page.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Clean and responsive interface with Bootstrap integration.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip (Python package manager)
- A code editor (e.g., PyCharm)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Riya72-coder/covid-19-analysis-and-dashboard.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd covid-dashboard
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Datasets**
   Due to GitHub's file size limits, the large datasets are not included in this repository. Please download them from their original sources on Kaggle:

   *   **Sentiment Data:** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhaydhiman/covid19-sentiments) (Rename downloaded file to `COVID-19_Sentiments.csv`)
   *   **Main Analysis Data:** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akcoguz/outputcsb) (Rename downloaded file to `output.csv`)
   *   **Vaccination Data:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/india-covid-vaccination-by-state-2023(Rename downloaded file to `IndiaCovidVaccination2023.csv`)

   **Action:** Place these CSV files inside the `data/` folder of this project.

5. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python flask_app.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to:
